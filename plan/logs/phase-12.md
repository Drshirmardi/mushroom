- `plan/STATUS.md`
- `plan/phases/12-PRODUCTION-HARDENING.md`
- `plan/logs/phase-12.md`

Migrations:

- none

Tests run:

- release-envelope required-control traceability scan → PASS
- external-gate owner/boundary review → PASS
- no-secret/no-runtime owned-path review → PASS
- `git diff --check` → PASS

Result:

- The target release and approved F12-T02 Sadad extension are recorded without claiming payment activation or
  acceptance completion.
- Liara staging/production and manual artifact promotion/rollback are fixed; static outbound egress confirmation is
  assigned to the project owner and blocks only real Sadad connection/payment sign-off.
- Capacity, availability, RPO/RTO, secret rotation/key-readability, object-storage N/A and fail-closed Sadad rules are
  executable task inputs with owning future tasks.

Known limitations:

- Liara static outbound egress, merchant acceptance, backup/secret-store capability and monthly availability evidence
  remain future external/implementation gates. They do not block F12-T01.

Next batch:

- F12-B02 / F12-T02 remains unclaimed.
